# JamShield: A Machine Learning Detection Algorithm for Over the Air Jamming Attacks

This repository contains the dataset used in the research paper _"JamShield: A Machine Learning Detection Algorithm for Over-the-Air Jamming Attacks"_. The research was conducted by **Ioannis Panitsas**, **Yagmur Yigit**,  **Leandros Tassiulas** and **Leandros Maglaras** from **Yale University** and **Edinburgh Napier University**.

For any inquiries, please contact **Ioannis Panitsas** at [ioannis.panitsas@yale.edu](mailto:ioannis.panitsas@yale.edu).

## Dataset

Each dataset corresponds to a specific jamming type. You can access the raw files by clicking on the links below:

- [Normal Channel](#)  
- [Constant Jammer](#)  
- [Random Jammer](#)

Each dataset file contains the following columns:

- **Received Signal Strength (RSS)**
- **Jamming Signals**

For more information on how the data was collected, please refer to the [published paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3567445.3567456).

### Implementation

The code was initially implemented in **GNURadio** and later converted to Python. Below is the flow graph used for the implementation.
